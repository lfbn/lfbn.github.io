Later I joined the AEIOU network, and rebrand the website to Poweruser.pt. At its peak, it reached 300k monthly visits. I developed it using HTML, Javascript, CSS, PHP, MySQL, WordPress and also added a separated application in Symfony. All the content was managed using WordPress, and in addition, I've created a separated application in Symfony, who received HTTP requests for newsletters subscriptions but also connected via XML-RPC to the website to pull the latest posts. This separated application was responsible for managing e-mail newsletters and also to create publications on Tumblr, Twitter, and Facebook. In 2015 I've sold this project.",
